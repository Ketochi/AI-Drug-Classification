# AI-Drug-Classification
This project maps drug active ingredients (APIs) and therapeutic uses into structured metrics for predicting side effects and pharmacological classes. It leverages tokenization, embeddings, multi-label binarization (MLB), and a machine learning transformer (MLT) to enable efficient feature extraction and robust classification.
