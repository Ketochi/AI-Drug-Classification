üß©**Problem to be Solved**

The biomedical domain generates vast amounts of unstructured text in the form of drug descriptions, clinical notes, and patient reports. Extracting meaningful insights from this text is challenging, as traditional methods rely heavily on curated databases and manual annotation. These approaches are time‚Äëconsuming, prone to human error, and struggle to keep pace with the rapid introduction of new drugs. As a result, clinicians and researchers often lack timely, automated tools to determine:

1. The pharmacological class a drug belongs to.

2. The potential side effects associated with its use.

This gap between unstructured biomedical text and actionable treatment knowledge limits progress in drug discovery, pharmacovigilance, and clinical decision‚Äëmaking.

üéØ**Objectives**

The study ‚ÄúFrom Text to Treatment‚Äù aims to:

1. Develop an automated system that predicts both drug classes and side effects directly from textual descriptions of drugs (composition, uses, APIs).

2. Leverage PubMedBERT embeddings and multi‚Äëlabel classification models to transform unstructured biomedical text into structured, clinically relevant predictions.

3. Reduce reliance on manual curation by providing a scalable, data‚Äëdriven approach to drug classification and safety profiling.

4. Evaluate the performance of the system using appropriate multi‚Äëlabel metrics to ensure reliability and clinical relevance.

**Applications**

The outcomes of this study have wide‚Äëranging applications, including:

‚Ä¢ Drug Discovery: Screening candidate compounds for likely pharmacological classes and side effect profiles early in the pipeline.

‚Ä¢ Pharmacovigilance: Supporting post‚Äëmarketing surveillance by predicting and flagging potential adverse reactions.

‚Ä¢ Clinical Decision Support: Assisting healthcare professionals in identifying drug classes and safety risks for lesser‚Äëknown or newly introduced drugs.

‚Ä¢ Biomedical Research: Enabling large‚Äëscale text mining of biomedical literature to uncover patterns in drug usage, classes, and side effects.

‚Ä¢ Knowledge Management: Providing structured insights that can be integrated into drug databases, electronic health records, and knowledge graphs.
